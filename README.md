### Virtual Machines VS Docker:

Using Docker is lighter than having to embed a complete operating system. Here, the Docker container shares the machine's kernel (Linux, Windows, etc.) and only carries what is necessary (the application and its dependencies).

#### Comparatif VM et Docker:

| Criteria    | Virtual machine                         | Docker container           |
| :---------- | :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| Startup     | Minutes (full OS boot)                  | Seconds (single process)   |
| Disc size   | Gigabytes (full OS)                     | Megabytes (app only)       |
| RAM         | Reserved in blocks (e.g., 4 GB minimum) | Shared dynamically         |
| Isolation   | Complete (hardware hypervisor)          | Process (Linux namespaces) |
| Density     | 10-20 VMs per server                    | Hundreds of containers     |
| Portability | Average (proprietary VM format)         | Excellent (OCI standard)   |

### Secrets VS Environments Variables

The main difference between Docker secrets and environment variables is that a Docker secret can only be accessed by a service when explicitly granted a secrets attribute within the services top-level element. The secrets are then mounted as a file under /run/secrets/<secret_name> inside the container.
Environments variables are often available to ass processes and it can be difficult to track access. They can also be printed in logs when debugging without your knowledge.

### Docker Network VS Host Network

| Type   | Isolation | Performance | Multi-host | Main use case                     |
| :----- | :-------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------------------------- |
| Bridge | ✅ Good   | ✅ Good     | ❌ No      | Development, multi-container apps |
| Host   | ❌ None   | ⚡ Maximum  | ❌ No      | Critical performance, monitoring  |

#### Bridge network (Docker network)

> In terms of Docker, a bridge network uses a software bridge which lets containers connected to the same bridge network communicate, while providing isolation from containers that aren't connected to that bridge network.<br>
> ==> [https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/bridge/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/bridge/)

#### Host Network

> If you use the host network mode for a container, that container's network stack isn't isolated from the Docker host (the container shares the host's networking namespace), and the container doesn't get its own IP-address allocated. For instance, if you run a container which binds to port 80 and you use host networking, the container's application is available on port 80 on the host's IP address.<br>

### Docker Volumes VS Bind Mounts

Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. While bind mounts are dependent on the directory structure and OS of the host machine, volumes are completely managed by Docker. Volumes are a good choice for the following use cases:

- Volumes are easier to back up or migrate than bind mounts.
- You can manage volumes using Docker CLI commands or the Docker API.
- Volumes work on both Linux and Windows containers.
- Volumes can be more safely shared among multiple containers.
- New volumes can have their content pre-populated by a container or build.
- When your application requires high-performance I/O.

Volumes are not a good choice if you need to access the files from the host, as the volume is completely managed by Docker. Use bind mounts if you need to access files or directories from both containers and the host.

In our case we will use Docker Volumes cause we don't need to access the files from the host.
